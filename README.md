# Mattermost Private Cloud ![CircleCI branch](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/mattermost/mattermost-cloud/master.svg)

Mattermost Private Cloud is a SaaS offering meant to smooth and accelerate the customer journey from trial to full adoption. There is a significant amount of friction for a customer to set up a trial of Mattermost, and even more friction to run an extended length proof of concept. Both require hardware and technical personnel resources that create a significant barrier to potential customers. Mattermost Cloud aims to remove this barrier by providing a service to provision and host Mattermost instances that can be used by customers who have no technical experience. This will accelerate the customer journey to a full adoption of Mattermost either in the form of moving to a self-hosted instance or by continuing to use the cloud service.

## Developing

### Environment Setup

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Install [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) version v0.11.14
3. Install [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/install.md) version 1.15.X
4. Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/) version 2.14.X
5. Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
7. Install [mockery](github.com/vektra/mockery) version 1.0.0
6. Specify the region in your AWS config, e.g. `~/.aws/config`:
```
[profile mm-cloud]
region = us-east-1
```
7. Generate an AWS Access and Secret key pair, then export them in your bash profile:
  ```
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOURACCESSKEYID
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOURSECRETACCESSKEY
  export AWS_PROFILE=mm-cloud
  ```
8. Create an S3 bucket to store the kops state
9. Clone this repository into your GOPATH (or anywhere if you have Go Modules enabled)

### Building

Simply run the following:

```
$ go install ./cmd/cloud
```

### Running

Before running the server the first time you must set up the DB with:

```
$ cloud schema migrate
```

Run the server with:

```
$ cloud server --state-store=<your-s3-bucket> --private-dns dev.cloud.internal.mattermost.com
```

### Testing

Run the go tests to test:

```
$ go test ./...
```

### Deprecation Instructions

#### Terraform remote state and the ./clusters directory

The cloud server used to store all terraform generated by kops locally in the `./clusters` directory.

This has been updated and the server now uses remote state in S3 for storing terraform state. The `./clusters` directory is now completely ignored. To manually update your terraform to use remote state, do the following:

```
cd clusters/CLUSTER_ID
terraform init -backend-config=bucket=NAME_OF_KOPS_STATE_BUCKET -backend-config=region=us-east-1 -backend-config=key=terraform/KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME -force-copy
```

Repeat for every cluster in `./clusters` dir.
Note that `KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME` is not just the cluster ID. Run `kops get clusters` to get the full kops cluster names.

# Mattermost Cloud ![CircleCI branch](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/mattermost/mattermost-cloud/master.svg)

Mattermost Cloud is a SaaS offering meant to smooth and accelerate the customer journey from trial to full adoption. There is a significant amount of friction for a customer to set up a trial of Mattermost, and even more friction to run an extended length proof of concept. Both require hardware and technical personnel resources that create a significant barrier to potential customers. Mattermost Cloud aims to remove this barrier by providing a service to provision and host Mattermost instances that can be used by customers who have no technical experience. This will accelerate the customer journey to a full adoption of Mattermost either in the form of moving to a self-hosted instance or by continuing to use the cloud service.
